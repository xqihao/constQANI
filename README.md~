# [VAWEs (Viscoacoustic Anisotropic Wave Equations)](https://github.com/xqihao)
The Mathematica code for calcuating the point-source radiation from the scalar viscoacoustic orthorhombic wave equation.

The wave equation plays a central role in seismic modeling, processing, imaging and inversion. Incorporating attenuation anisotropy into the acoustic anisotropic wave equations provides a choice for acoustic forward and inverse modeling in attenuating anisotropic media. However, the existing viscoacoustic anisotropic wave equations are obtained for a specified viscoacoustic model. We have developed a relatively general representation of the scalar and vector viscoacoustic wave equations for orthorhombic anisotropy. We also obtain the viscoacoustic wave equations for transverse isotropy as a special case. The viscoacoustic orthorhombic wave equations are flexible for multiple viscoacoustic models. We take into account the classic visocoacoustic models such as the Kelvin-Voigt, Maxwell, standard-linear-solid and Kjartansson models, and we derive the corresponding viscoacoustic wave equations in differential form. To analyze the wave propagation in viscoacoustic models, we derive the asymptotic acoustic point-source radiation. Numerical examples indicate a comparison of the acoustic waveforms excited by a point source in the viscoacoustic orthorhombic models and the corresponding nonattenuating model, and the effect of the attenuation anisotropy on the acoustic waveforms.

## Running the code
Use the Mathematica software to open any one of the ".nb" file. Click the Evaluation option, and then click the Evaluate Notebook option. Now, the code should be run. It may take tens minutes to finish. The PDF figure is generated in the same folder automatically.   
The code are run in Mathematica 10.0.1.0 successfully.


## Acknowledgements
This paper is nominated by Geophysics editors to be highlighted in the Geophysics Bright Spots in The Leading Edge. We thank the Geophysics editors's help for introducing our research work.


## Output Figures
The output figures are exactly the same as those in the journal paper. All these figures are stored as the vector graphics of the PDF format. Hence, you may amplify the figures to see more details about the waveforms.


## Suggestions
We strongly suggest you first reading the journal paper and then running the code to reporduce the figures. This may help you understand the whole theory about viscoacoustic anisotropy in the paper.

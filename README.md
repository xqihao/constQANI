Use the Jupyter notebook to open any one of the ".ipynb" file. Click the Evaluation option, and then click the Evaluate Notebook option. 


## Acknowledgements
This paper is nominated by Geophysics editors to be highlighted in the Geophysics Bright Spots in The Leading Edge. We thank the Geophysics editors's help for introducing our research work.


## Output Figures
The output figures are exactly the same as those in the journal paper. All these figures are stored as the vector graphics of the PDF format. Hence, you may amplify the figures to see more details about the waveforms.
